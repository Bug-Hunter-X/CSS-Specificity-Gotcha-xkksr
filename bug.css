The CSS specificity rules can be confusing.  For example, consider the following:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.highlight {
  color: red;
}

#specific {
  color: green;
}

#specific.highlight {
  color: purple;
}
```

The element with the id `specific` and class `highlight` will be purple.  However, it's easy to make subtle errors where you unintentionally override styles with higher specificity selectors, leading to unexpected visual results.

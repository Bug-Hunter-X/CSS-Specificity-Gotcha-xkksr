To fix this, we need to understand how CSS specificity works and write our selectors more carefully.  We can improve the code to be more maintainable and less prone to specificity issues by being more mindful of selector order and making sure to use more specific selectors only when necessary. 

Here's an improved version:

```css
/* Base styles */
div {
  color: blue; 
}

/* More specific styles override less specific styles */
.highlight {
  color: red;
}

#specific {
  color: green;
}

#specific.highlight {
  color: purple; /* This is still the most specific and will take precedence*/
}

/* Add more specific selectors as needed, following a clear naming convention */
```
We've organized the CSS by specificity, ensuring the styles are applied in a predictable manner.
